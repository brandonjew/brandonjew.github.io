About a year ago, I gave my first conference talk at ASHG 2019 in Houston, Texas.
I presented my work on estimating the proportion of different cell types in RNA
sequencing samples.

There's a lot to say about the method (it's called Bisque) but this post is more about
a small experience sharing it with the community.
If you're interested, the paper has been published in
[Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15816-6) and
I also gave a fairly technical talk back in April over Zoom (due to COVID)
hosted by [UCLA QCB](https://qcb.ucla.edu/event/qcbio-research-seminar-brandon-jew-halperin-sul-lab/).

As the post title states, I was nervous for my talk.
The room and the audience ended up being a lot bigger than I expected.
Here's my heart rate leading up to and during my presentation brought to you by my Apple Watch:

  </div>

<br>

As you can see, I took the stage at 11AM, coinciding with the 162 BPM peak.
For reference, my heart rate tops out around 170 for my somewhat intensive bike rides. 
As reflected in the data, I distinctly remember feeling more comfortable as I got my talk going. The talk went great and I got a lot of interesting questions afterwards, which was definitely reassuring.

Also, according to my watch, I burned 415 Calories giving this talk!

Looking forward to future conferences when we can all see each other in person again
and I can check if I'm getting more comfortable with public speaking.
