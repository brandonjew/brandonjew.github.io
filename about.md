I'm a grad student working with
[Eran Halperin](https://www.eranhalperingenomics.com/) and
[Jae Hoon Sul](https://jaehoonsullab.semel.ucla.edu/). 

My research is at the interesection of biology, statistics, and computer science.
Right now, I'm developing methods to better understand the role of genetics in
disease from large-scale multiomics sequencing data.
