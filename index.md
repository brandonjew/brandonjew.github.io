I'm a grad student working with
[Eran Halperin](https://www.eranhalperingenomics.com/) and
[Jae Hoon Sul](https://jaehoonsullab.semel.ucla.edu/). 

My research is at the interesection of biology, statistics, and computer science.
Right now, I'm developing methods to better understand our genome and its role in
complex diseases.
I'm also interested in getting people more involved in research with [Big Bio](https://www.big-bio.org/) and understanding/responding to the COVID-19 pandemic with [STOPCOVID](https://stopcovid19together.org/).
