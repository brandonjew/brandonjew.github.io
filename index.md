I'm a machine learning scientist at Amgen where I develop methods to accelerate therapeutic discovery.

I did my PhD at UCLA under the supervision of Eran Halperin and Jae Hoon Sul. I developed statistical methods to better understand our genome and its role in complex diseases from genetic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic data. Prior to grad school, I was involved in proteomics research as an undergrad in biochemistry at UCLA.
