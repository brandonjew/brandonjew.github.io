Iâ€™m a scientist applying machine learning to advance human health, from biological research to clinical outcomes.

Previously, I was a principal scientist at Amgen, where I developed predictive and generative models to accelerate biologics discovery and optimization.

I did my PhD at UCLA under the supervision of Eran Halperin and Jae Hoon Sul, developing scalable statistical methods to better understand complex diseases from multi-omics data. I also completed my undergraduate degree in biochemistry at UCLA, with research experience in proteomics and molecular biology.
