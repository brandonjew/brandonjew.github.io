Iâ€™m a principal machine learning scientist at Amgen. I'm developing predictive and generative models to accelerate biologics discovery and optimization.

I did my PhD at UCLA under the supervision of Eran Halperin and Jae Hoon Sul. I developed scalable statistical methods to better understand complex diseases from multi-omics data. Prior to grad school, I was involved in proteomics research as an undergrad in biochemistry at UCLA.
